            <h2>Dear MDBootstrap!</h2>

            <p>My name is Paulina Chojecka. I have found your internship offer on Facebook's group "Praca dla grafik√≥w komputerowych" and I said: "This is place for me!".</p><br>
            <div class="box3">


                <p>I am Junior VR/AR Designer in softwarehouse Polidea. Previously I was a Graphic Designer for ~3 years. I can use <span>Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign</span>. Sometimes I use also <span>Adobe After Effects, Premiere Pro and Animate</span> to make some animations.<br> During last year I find my new hobby - <span>UX</span>. I established UX scientific society at my academy (Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology) and I learned also <span>Sketch, Marvel and Moqups</span>. I was participated in making sites as a UX Designer like <a href="www.geitner24.de">Geitner24.de</a> ; <a href="https://www.obligacjespoleczne.eu/">ObligacjeSpoleczne.eu</a> (PS: the banner concept was not my idea). </p><br>
            </div>

            <div class="box4">
                <p>My biggest dream is work with <span>new technologies, mobile apps and people who make awesome modern websites.</span> I want to know everything about Front-end Development. In the future I will make perfect WebVR experiences :) </p><br>
            </div>

            <div class="box5">
                <p>I have finished <span>Front-End Developer course</span> on Akademia 108 in Warsaw and I believe that this knowledge helps me to better understand all process of making great websites/apps. Now is time for internship - I want to meet people who work with HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap technologies and learn from them. In the future probably I will teach other people (I wish!:) I have basic knowledge about HTML, CSS, JavaScript and C#. I use Brackets, Github and Gitlab. In current job I work with Unity and I use Sourcetree. </p><br>

            </div>

            <div class="box6">
                <p>I believe I can be part of <span>MDBootstrap Team</span>. I know that I still have a lot to learn, but trust me-<br> I am master in learning new skills and <span>I love to do it!</span> </p><br>
